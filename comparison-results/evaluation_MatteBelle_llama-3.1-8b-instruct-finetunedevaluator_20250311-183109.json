The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 7 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] against the references [['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the fox jumps over the lazy dog']] and the predictions ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky with a few white clouds']]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=true for the predictions ['The cat is very sleepy', 'The big red car is very slow'] and references = [['The dog is running quickly', 'The cat is very sleepy'], ['The big red car is very slow', 'The dog is running quickly']], the BERTScore with idf=true, language='en' for these predictions and references, the BLEU scores with rougeLsum, max_order=5, smooth=false for the predictions ['The sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'The birds are singing sweet melodies'] and references = ['The sun is shining very brightly in the clear blue sky', 'The birds are singing their beautiful songs'], the ROUGE scores with rouge2, rougeL, max_order=4, smooth=true for the predictions ['The big red car is very slow', 'The quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog'] and references = ['The dog is running quickly', 'The quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog'], and the BERTScore with rougeLsum, idf=false for these predictions and references?",

It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with max_order=5, smooth=true, for the predictions ['a quick brown fox jumps over the fence', 'the sun is shining brightly'] and the references [['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog'], ['the sun is shining warmly', 'the sun is shining brightly']], and the BERTScore with idf=true for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] and the references ['the dog is running fast', 'the dog is running quickly'], and the ROUGE score rougeL for the predictions ['the big brown bear is happy', 'the big brown bear is smiling'] and the references ['the big brown bear is smiling', 'the big brown bear is happy'], and the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) with use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=false, rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'] for the predictions ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the fence', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] and the references [['the quick brown fox', 'the quick brown fox jumps over the fence'], ['the cat is sleeping', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']]?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics for the generated summaries ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping'] and ['the cat is barking', 'the dog is playing outside'] against the human-written summaries [['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping'], ['the cat is barking', 'the dog is playing outside']] and [['the dog is sleeping', 'the cat is running quickly'], ['the cat is barking', 'the dog is sleeping']] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeL'] and also against the references ['the cat is sleeping the dog is barking the sun is shining', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding'] and ['the dog is sleeping the cat is barking the sun is shining', 'the dog is barking the cat is sleeping the sun is hiding'] with BERTScore using lang 'en', idf 0.5, and compare the ROUGE and BERTScore results for the first generated summary against the second human-written summary and the first reference, and also compare the ROUGE and BERTScore results for the second generated summary against the first human-written summary and the second reference, and also compare the ROUGE and BERTScore results for the first generated summary against the first human-written summary and the first reference?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: llm_judge, perplexity\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: llm_judge\n  Description: LLM Judge uses a language model's own evaluation capabilities to assess the quality of a candidate text from multiple perspectives. Given a candidate text, a set of quality criteria, and optionally reference texts, the model returns a score (on a defined scale) and, if requested, a detailed explanation of its judgment.\n  Required parameters:\n    - candidate_texts: The texts whose quality is to be evaluated.\n    - quality_criteria: A list of aspects to evaluate (coherence, creativity, relevance, fluency).\n    - scale_max: The maximum value on the evaluation scale (e.g., 10 means scores will be in the range 0-10).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - explanation_required: If true, the LLM should provide a textual explanation along with the score.\n    - evaluation_type: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., 'numeric', 'binary', 'qualitative'). Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores of the texts: \"The futuristic cityscape is a marvel of modern engineering, with towering skyscrapers and advanced transportation systems.\", \"The local cuisine is a fusion of traditional and modern flavors, with a focus on using fresh, locally sourced ingredients.\", \"The city's commitment to innovation is evident in its cutting-edge research facilities and entrepreneurial spirit.\", \"The scenic coastal views offer breathtaking vistas of the ocean and surrounding landscape.\" with a batch size of 32 and adding a start token, and then I would like to use the LLM Judge API to evaluate the fluency, coherence, and relevance of the texts: \"The company's dedication to reducing its environmental footprint is commendable, and its efforts to promote sustainability are making a significant impact\", \"The students are working on a project to develop a sustainable product that meets the needs of the local community, with a focus on reducing waste and promoting eco-friendly practices\" with explanation_required set to true, evaluation_type set to numeric, and prompt_template set to \"Please evaluate the quality of the given texts based on the specified criteria, providing a detailed explanation of the scores and their significance.\"",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: llm_judge, perplexity\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: llm_judge\n  Description: LLM Judge uses a language model's own evaluation capabilities to assess the quality of a candidate text from multiple perspectives. Given a candidate text, a set of quality criteria, and optionally reference texts, the model returns a score (on a defined scale) and, if requested, a detailed explanation of its judgment.\n  Required parameters:\n    - candidate_texts: The texts whose quality is to be evaluated.\n    - quality_criteria: A list of aspects to evaluate (coherence, creativity, relevance, fluency).\n    - scale_max: The maximum value on the evaluation scale (e.g., 10 means scores will be in the range 0-10).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - explanation_required: If true, the LLM should provide a textual explanation along with the score.\n    - evaluation_type: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., 'numeric', 'binary', 'qualitative'). Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores for the following six texts: \"The cat chased its tail with enthusiasm.\", \"The dog wagged its tail in excitement.\", \"The baby laughed at the silly clown.\", \"The flowers bloomed beautifully in the garden.\", \"The kids played happily in the park.\", \"The tourists walked slowly through the ancient ruins.\", using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 5 and adding the start token, and how do the LLM Judge's scores for coherence, creativity, and relevance rate the quality of these same six sentences with a maximum score of 10, requiring explanations, using the 'numeric' evaluation type, and a custom prompt \"Please evaluate the text's coherence, creativity, and relevance as if it were a collection of fun and engaging stories, taking into account its ability to capture the reader's attention, and return both perplexity and LLM Judge results, also comparing the results with the scores obtained when the batch size is 2 and the model is set to t5, and including a reference list of six classic children's books: \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"The Jungle Book\", \"Peter Pan\", \"The Secret Garden\", \"The Lion King\"?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: llm_judge, perplexity\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: llm_judge\n  Description: LLM Judge uses a language model's own evaluation capabilities to assess the quality of a candidate text from multiple perspectives. Given a candidate text, a set of quality criteria, and optionally reference texts, the model returns a score (on a defined scale) and, if requested, a detailed explanation of its judgment.\n  Required parameters:\n    - candidate_texts: The texts whose quality is to be evaluated.\n    - quality_criteria: A list of aspects to evaluate (coherence, creativity, relevance, fluency).\n    - scale_max: The maximum value on the evaluation scale (e.g., 10 means scores will be in the range 0-10).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - explanation_required: If true, the LLM should provide a textual explanation along with the score.\n    - evaluation_type: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., 'numeric', 'binary', 'qualitative'). Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nHow do the perplexity scores of the texts 'The beauty of the sunset is breathtaking', 'The sound of the ocean waves is soothing', and 'The smell of freshly baked cookies is appetizing' compare between the gpt2 and t5 models with a batch size of 32 and start token added, and can the LLM judge the coherence, creativity, and fluency of these texts with an evaluation type of numeric and a prompt template of \"Assess the overall quality of the following passage for a travel brochure: Is it engaging and easy to read?\" with explanation of the judgment, and also how do the perplexity scores of these texts change when using the gpt3 model versus the gpt2 model with a batch size of 32 and start token added, and can the LLM judge the relevance and fluency of the texts 'The smell of freshly baked cookies is appetizing', 'The taste of a juicy burger is delicious' with an evaluation type of numeric and a prompt template of \"How well-suited is this passage for a food blog?\" with explanation of the judgment, and how do the perplexity scores of the texts 'The majestic mountain peaks touch the sky', 'The serene lake reflects the beauty of nature', and 'The vibrant city streets are alive with energy' compare between the gpt2 and t5 models with a batch size of 32 and start token added, and can the LLM judge the coherence, creativity, and fluency of these texts with an evaluation type of numeric and a prompt template of \"Assess the overall quality of the following passage for a travel brochure: Is it engaging and easy to read?\" with explanation of the judgment.",

Otherwise, returns the fraction of correctly classified samples\n    - sample_weight: Predicted labels\n\nMetric name: recall\n  Description: Recall measures the proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identified (Recall = TP / (TP + FN)), indicating the model's sensitivity.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: Predicted labels.\n    - references: Ground Truth labels.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - average: This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets. If None, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this determines the type of averaging performed on the data (e.g., 'binary', 'macro', 'micro', 'weighted', 'samples').\n    - labels: The set of labels to include when average is not set to 'binary', and the order of the labels if average is None.\n    - pos_label: The class to be considered the positive class, in the case where average is set to binary.\n    - sample_weight: Sample weights.\n\nMetric name: f1\n  Description: The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a classifier's performance, especially when classes are imbalanced.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The *N* predicted labels.\n    - references: The *N* true labels.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - average: The averaging method to use (e.g., 'macro', 'micro', 'weighted').\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the accuracy, f1 scores with average set to micro and macro, and recall of two models that predict three classes with the predicted labels [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], the actual labels [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], and sample weights [0.2, 0.5, 0.3], and how do these metrics change when the actual labels are [1, 1, 1] and the sample weights are adjusted to [0.5, 0.3, 0.2], and also when the normalize parameter is set to false for accuracy, the average is set to micro for the f1 score calculation, and the sample weights are adjusted to [0.1, 0.6, 0.3] and [0.4, 0.2, 0.4]?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: llm_judge, perplexity\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: llm_judge\n  Description: LLM Judge uses a language model's own evaluation capabilities to assess the quality of a candidate text from multiple perspectives. Given a candidate text, a set of quality criteria, and optionally reference texts, the model returns a score (on a defined scale) and, if requested, a detailed explanation of its judgment.\n  Required parameters:\n    - candidate_texts: The texts whose quality is to be evaluated.\n    - quality_criteria: A list of aspects to evaluate (coherence, creativity, relevance, fluency).\n    - scale_max: The maximum value on the evaluation scale (e.g., 10 means scores will be in the range 0-10).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - explanation_required: If true, the LLM should provide a textual explanation along with the score.\n    - evaluation_type: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., 'numeric', 'binary', 'qualitative'). Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores of the following texts: \"The tourists are exploring the historic city center.\", \"The kids are playing soccer in the park.\", \"The new policy aims to improve public transportation and reduce traffic congestion.\", \"The smell of freshly baked cookies wafted through the air.\", \"The researchers are studying the effects of climate change on polar bears.\", \"The city is famous for its art museums and galleries.\" with a batch size of 16 and adding a start token, and then I would like to use the LLM Judge API to evaluate the fluency, coherence, and relevance of the texts: \"The company is investing in sustainable energy sources and reducing its carbon footprint.\", \"The students are working on a project to develop a new sustainable product and improve public transportation.\" with an explanation, a scale max of 10, and a prompt template \"Please assess these texts for fluency, coherence, and relevance in the context of a business sustainability report\", and then use the perplexity API to evaluate the perplexity of the LLM Judge API's outputs.",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat is the perplexity of the text sequences [\"The morning sun rises over the horizon.\", \"The birds sing their morning songs.\", \"The dew glistens on the grass.\", \"The world awakens from its slumber.\", \"The sky brightens with a warm light.\", \"The day begins with hope.\"] and [\"The evening shadows fall across the wall.\", \"The crickets chirp their evening songs.\", \"The stars twinkle in the night sky.\", \"The world slows down its pace.\", \"The moon glows with a soft light.\", \"The night brings a sense of calm.\"] using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 32 and adding a start token, and how does the LLM Judge evaluate the coherence, creativity, relevance, and fluency of the candidate texts [\"The story was a wild ride with its unexpected twists and turns.\", \"The characters were well-developed and relatable.\", \"The plot kept me engaged until the very end.\", \"The author's writing style was unique and captivating.\", \"The themes were thought-provoking and meaningful.\", \"The story left a lasting impression on me.\"] in comparison to the reference texts [\"The morning light peeks through the blinds.\", \"The city awakens from its slumber.\", \"The sounds of the city fill the air.\", \"The people rush to start their day.\", \"The energy is vibrant and lively.\", \"The city never sleeps.\"] and [\"The evening shadows dance across the wall.\", \"The crickets chirp their evening songs.\", \"The stars shine brightly in the night sky.\", \"The world slows down its pace.\", \"The moon glows with a soft light.\", \"The night brings a sense of calm.\"] and [\"The dog runs quickly through the park.\", \"The flowers bloom in the garden.\", \"The children laugh and play.\", \"The sun shines down on their faces.\", \"The air is filled with joy and happiness.\", \"The scene is peaceful and serene.\"] with a scale max of 20, requiring an explanation, using a numeric evaluation type, and a custom prompt template \"Please evaluate the candidate texts based on their ability to engage the reader and convey a clear message.\"",

Given a candidate text, a set of quality criteria, and optionally reference texts, the model returns a score (on a defined scale) and, if requested, a detailed explanation of its judgment.\n  Required parameters:\n    - candidate_texts: The texts whose quality is to be evaluated.\n    - quality_criteria: A list of aspects to evaluate (coherence, creativity, relevance, fluency).\n    - scale_max: The maximum value on the evaluation scale (e.g., 10 means scores will be in the range 0-10).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - explanation_required: If true, the LLM should provide a textual explanation along with the score.\n    - evaluation_type: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., 'numeric', 'binary', 'qualitative'). Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores for the texts ['The beach is a great place to relax.', 'The sound of the waves is calming.'] and ['The city is a bustling metropolis.', 'The smell of freshly brewed coffee is invigorating.'] using the gpt2 and t5 models respectively with a batch size of 16 and start token added, and can the LLM judge the coherence and fluency of the texts ['The beach is a great place to relax.', 'The sound of the waves is calming.'] with an evaluation type of numeric and a prompt template of \"Evaluate the overall quality of the following passage for a travel brochure: Is it engaging and easy to read?\" with an explanation of the judgment, and also how do the perplexity scores of these two sets of texts compare between the two models, and can the LLM judge the relevance and creativity of the texts ['The city is a bustling metropolis.', 'The smell of freshly brewed coffee is invigorating.'] with an evaluation type of numeric and a prompt template of \"How well-suited is this passage for a travel brochure about urban destinations?\" with an explanation of the judgment, and how do the results of the numeric evaluations compare between the two sets of texts?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores for the summaries ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping soundly'] and references ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping soundly'] with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 5 and smoothing enabled, and the ROUGE scores for these summaries and translations with ROUGE's types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] and aggregator disabled, and stemmer applied, and also the BERTScores for these summaries and references with language set to 'en' and inverse document frequency reweighting enabled, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] and references ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the cat is sleeping peacefully'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rouge2'] and aggregator enabled, and stemmer applied, and the BERTScores for these summaries and references with language set to 'en' and inverse document frequency reweighting disabled?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BERTScore with idf set to true, ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to true, and BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 4 and smoothing disabled, for the predictions ['the cat', 'the dog'] against the references [['the cat', 'the dog'], ['a fast brown fox', 'a fast brownish fox']] and the predictions ['the quick brown fox', 'jumps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['a dog is running', 'a cat is sleeping'] against the references [['a dog is running quickly', 'a cat is sleeping soundly'], ['a dog is running quickly', 'a cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['the sun is shining', 'the sun is shining'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly', 'the sun is shining'], ['the sun is setting slowly', 'the sun is shining in the clear sky']]?",

It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU scores for the following predictions and references: predictions = ['The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'The sun is setting slowly over the calm ocean'], references = [['The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'The sun sets slowly over the calm ocean'], ['The quick brown fox is a clever animal', 'The sun is setting slowly over the calm ocean']], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, max_order=4, smooth=True?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) and BLEU scores (with max_order=4, smooth=false) for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the big brown bear is happy'], references=[['the dog is running fast', 'the dog is running quickly'], ['the big brown bear is smiling', 'the big brown bear is happy']], and the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) and BLEU score (with max_order=3, smooth=true) for the predictions ['a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], references=[['a fast brown fox jumps over the sleepy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog'], ['the cat is sleeping peacefully', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores for the machine translations ['the beautiful morning', 'the sun is shining brightly'], human references ['the beautiful morning with a cup of coffee', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], and model references ['the morning is beautiful', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky'] with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 5, smoothing disabled, and also the BERTScores for these translations and references with language set to 'en', inverse document frequency reweighting disabled, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky with a few fluffy white clouds'], human references ['the morning is beautiful', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], and model references ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], aggregator enabled, and no stemming applied, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining'], human references ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the morning is beautiful'], and model references ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'], aggregator enabled, and stemmer applied?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types as 'rouge1', 'rouge2', and 'rougeL', using the aggregator and with stemming, for the generated summaries: 'The restaurant's unique atmosphere combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a hint of elegance and a touch of modernity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of modernity and a touch of elegance', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The new restaurant offers a unique menu that combines traditional and modern flavors with a dash of creativity and a hint of elegance and a touch of modernity', and also calculate the BLEU scores for the translations: 'The cat is sitting on the mat', 'a quick brown fox', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping on the couch', 'the brown fox is jumping over the dog', 'the dog is running quickly outside'?",

BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU and ROUGE scores for the following translations and references, with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 5 and ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rouge2'], stemmer applied, and aggregator enabled, given the predictions ['the cat sat on the mat', 'the quick brown fox'] and references [['the cat is sitting on the mat', 'the cat is laying on the mat'], ['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog']]?",

It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU scores of the following predictions and references: predictions = ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear sky', 'the dog is barking loudly'], references = [['the sun is shining brightly', 'the sun is shining warmly'], ['the dog is whining softly', 'the dog is barking loudly']], rouge_types = ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator = True, use_stemmer = False, max_order = 5, smooth = True?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types as 'rouge1', 'rouge2', and 'rougeL', using the aggregator, and with stemming, for the generated summaries: 'The restaurant's unique atmosphere combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience provides a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of elegance', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance', and also calculate the BLEU scores with max_order as 4 and smooth as true for the summaries: 'The restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The menu blends traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience offers a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance', and also calculate the BERTScores with idf as true for the summaries: 'The restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience provides a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of elegance', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance'.",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics for the generated summaries ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly'] and ['the dog is sleeping', 'the cat is running slowly'] against the human-written summaries [['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly'], ['the dog is sleeping', 'the cat is running slowly']] and [['the dog is sleeping', 'the cat is running slowly'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly']] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeL'] and also against the references ['the cat is running quickly the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running slowly the sun is shining brightly'] and ['the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is barking the sun is shining'] with BERTScore using lang 'en', idf 0.5, and compare the ROUGE and BERTScore results for the first generated summary against the second human-written summary and the first reference, and also compare the ROUGE and BERTScore results for the second generated summary against the first human-written summary and the second reference, and also compare the ROUGE results for the two generated summaries against the two human-written summaries using ROUGE types ['rougeLsum']?",

It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types as 'rouge1' and 'rougeL', using the aggregator, and with stemming, for the generated summaries: 'The new restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a hint of elegance', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance', and also calculate the BERTScores with idf as false for the summaries: 'The restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a hint of elegance', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance'",

BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.
