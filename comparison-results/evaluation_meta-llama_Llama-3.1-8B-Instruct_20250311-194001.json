The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 7 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] against the references [['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the fox jumps over the lazy dog']] and the predictions ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky with a few white clouds']]?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with max_order=4 and smooth=true for the predictions ['the cat is very happy', 'the dog is running quickly'] and the references [['the cat is purring', 'the cat is meowing'], ['the dog is running fast', 'the dog is wagging its tail']], and the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) with use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=false, rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] for the predictions ['the big brown bear is smiling', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] and the references [['the big brown bear is smiling', 'the big brown bear is happy'], ['the cat is purring', 'the cat is meowing']], and the ROUGE score rougeL for the predictions ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the fence', 'the dog is wagging its tail'] and the references ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog', 'the quick brown fox is jumping over the sleepy dog'], and the BERTScore with idf=true for the predictions ['the dog is wagging its tail', 'the cat is very happy'] and the references ['the dog is running quickly', 'the dog is running fast'], and the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) with use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=false, rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] for the predictions ['the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the dog is running quickly'] and the references [['the cat is purring', 'the cat is meowing'], ['the dog is running fast', 'the dog is wagging its tail']], and the rouge with the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] and the references ['the dog is running fast', 'the dog is wagging its tail'], and the bleu with the predictions ['the cat is purring', 'the dog is wagging its tail'] and the references ['the cat is meowing', 'the cat is purring'].",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BERTScore for the following predictions and references: predictions=['The cat is very happy', 'The dog is very sad'], references=[['The cat is happy', 'the dog is sad'], ['The cat is very happy', 'the dog is very sad']], predictions=['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], references=[['The quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog']], predictions=['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'], references=[['The sun is shining', 'the dog is running'], ['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly']], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, max_order=5, smooth=False, lang='en'",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 8 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky']] and the predictions ['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog slowly'] against the references [['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']]?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: llm_judge, perplexity\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: llm_judge\n  Description: LLM Judge uses a language model's own evaluation capabilities to assess the quality of a candidate text from multiple perspectives. Given a candidate text, a set of quality criteria, and optionally reference texts, the model returns a score (on a defined scale) and, if requested, a detailed explanation of its judgment.\n  Required parameters:\n    - candidate_texts: The texts whose quality is to be evaluated.\n    - quality_criteria: A list of aspects to evaluate (coherence, creativity, relevance, fluency).\n    - scale_max: The maximum value on the evaluation scale (e.g., 10 means scores will be in the range 0-10).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - explanation_required: If true, the LLM should provide a textual explanation along with the score.\n    - evaluation_type: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., 'numeric', 'binary', 'qualitative'). Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexities of the following texts: \"The soft petals of the cherry blossoms sway gently in the spring breeze.\", \"The warmth of the fireplace crackles and spits as I sit by the cozy hearth.\", \"The feeling of the soft blanket beneath me is comforting as I snuggle up with a good book.\", \"The taste of rich hot chocolate is decadent as I sip it by the fire.\", \"The vibrant colors of the aurora borealis dance across the night sky with ethereal beauty.\" using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 32 and adding the start token, and how does the LLM Judge evaluate the coherence, creativity, and relevance of a text that is a combination of the first and fourth texts, and what is the perplexity of the second text, and what is the perplexity of the fifth text, using a prompt template \"Please evaluate the text as if it were a serene natural scene\", and requiring an explanation of the scores, and performing a qualitative evaluation, and can the LLM Judge also evaluate the factuality of a text that is a combination of the third and second texts, and how does the perplexity of the first text compare to the perplexity of the third text, and what is the perplexity of the fifth text in comparison to the perplexity of the second text?",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores for the following six texts: \"The cat chased its tail with enthusiasm.\", \"The dog wagged its tail in excitement.\", \"The baby laughed at the silly clown.\", \"The flowers bloomed beautifully in the garden.\", \"The kids played happily in the park.\", \"The tourists walked slowly through the ancient ruins.\", using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 5 and adding the start token, and how do the LLM Judge's scores for coherence, creativity, and relevance rate the quality of these same six sentences with a maximum score of 10, requiring explanations, using the 'numeric' evaluation type, and a custom prompt \"Please evaluate the text's coherence, creativity, and relevance as if it were a collection of fun and engaging stories, taking into account its ability to capture the reader's attention, and return both perplexity and LLM Judge results, also comparing the results with the scores obtained when the batch size is 2 and the model is set to t5, and including a reference list of six classic children's books: \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"The Jungle Book\", \"Peter Pan\", \"The Secret Garden\", \"The Lion King\"?",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores for the texts 'The sound of the ocean waves is calming', 'The smell of freshly baked cookies is appetizing', and 'The taste of a juicy burger is delicious' using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 32 and start token added, and can the LLM judge the coherence, creativity, and fluency of these texts with an evaluation type of numeric and a prompt template of \"Assess the overall quality of the following passage for a food blog: Is it engaging and easy to read?\" with explanation of the judgment, and also how do the perplexity scores of these texts change when using the t5 model versus the gpt3 model with a batch size of 32 and start token added, and can the LLM judge the relevance and fluency of the text 'The smell of freshly baked cookies is appetizing' with an evaluation type of numeric and a prompt template of \"How well-suited is this passage for a food blog?\" with explanation of the judgment, and finally, can the perplexity scores of the first two texts be compared to the perplexity scores of the last text using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 32 and start token added?",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat is the perplexity of the text sequences [\"The morning light peeks through the blinds.\", \"The city awakens from its slumber.\", \"The sun rises over the horizon.\", \"The baby laughs at the silly clown.\", \"The dog runs quickly through the park.\", \"The flowers bloom in the garden.\"] and [\"The evening shadows fall across the wall.\", \"The crickets chirp their evening songs.\", \"The sun sets slowly over the ocean.\", \"The seagulls fly overhead.\", \"The baby coos at the playful kitten.\", \"The cat purrs contentedly on my lap.\"] using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 32 and adding a start token, and how does the LLM Judge evaluate the coherence, creativity, relevance, and fluency of the candidate texts [\"The story was a wild ride with its unexpected twists and turns.\", \"The characters were well-developed and relatable.\", \"The movie was breathtaking with its stunning visuals and unpredictable plot twists.\"] in comparison to the reference texts [\"The stars shine brightly in the night sky.\", \"The world is full of wonder.\", \"The flowers bloom in the colorful garden.\", \"The butterflies dance in the warm sunlight.\", \"The morning sunlight filters through the leaves.\", \"The birds chirp their sweet melodies.\"] and [\"The evening shadows dance across the wall.\", \"The crickets chirp their evening song.\", \"The baby laughs at the silly clown.\", \"The dog runs quickly through the park.\", \"The flowers bloom in the garden.\", \"The cat purrs contentedly on my lap.\"], with a scale max of 15, requiring an explanation, using a numeric evaluation type, and a custom prompt template \"Please assess the quality of the provided text based on the given criteria, providing a detailed explanation for each aspect and highlighting areas of improvement.\"",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat is the perplexity of the text sequences [\"The morning light peeks through the blinds.\", \"The city awakens from its slumber.\", \"The sun rises over the horizon.\", \"The birds sing their sweet melodies.\", \"The world is full of wonder.\", \"The beauty of nature is breathtaking.\"] and [\"The evening shadows fall across the wall.\", \"The crickets chirp their evening songs.\", \"The stars shine brightly in the night sky.\", \"The moon glows with a soft light.\", \"The night air is filled with magic.\", \"The world is at peace.\"] using the gpt2 model with a batch size of 32 and adding a start token, and how does the LLM Judge evaluate the coherence, creativity, relevance, and fluency of the candidate texts [\"The story was a wild ride with its unexpected twists and turns.\", \"The characters were well-developed and relatable.\", \"The plot was engaging and suspenseful.\", \"The writing was descriptive and vivid.\", \"The ending was surprising and memorable.\", \"The overall experience was enjoyable.\"] in comparison to the reference texts [\"The morning sunlight filters through the leaves.\", \"The birds sing their sweet melodies.\", \"The world is full of wonder.\", \"The beauty of nature is breathtaking.\", \"The simplicity of life is peaceful.\", \"The joy of living is contagious.\"] and [\"The evening shadows dance across the wall.\", \"The crickets chirp their evening songs.\", \"The stars shine brightly in the night sky.\", \"The moon glows with a soft light.\", \"The night air is filled with magic.\", \"The world is at peace.\"] and [\"The dog runs quickly through the park.\", \"The flowers bloom in the garden.\", \"The children laugh and play.\", \"The sunshine warms the skin.\", \"The fresh air is invigorating.\", \"The world is full of delight.\"] with a scale max of 20, requiring an explanation, using a numeric evaluation type, and a custom prompt template \"Please assess the quality of the provided text based on the given criteria, providing a detailed explanation of the strengths and weaknesses, and suggesting areas for improvement.\"",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: llm_judge, perplexity\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: llm_judge\n  Description: LLM Judge uses a language model's own evaluation capabilities to assess the quality of a candidate text from multiple perspectives. Given a candidate text, a set of quality criteria, and optionally reference texts, the model returns a score (on a defined scale) and, if requested, a detailed explanation of its judgment.\n  Required parameters:\n    - candidate_texts: The texts whose quality is to be evaluated.\n    - quality_criteria: A list of aspects to evaluate (coherence, creativity, relevance, fluency).\n    - scale_max: The maximum value on the evaluation scale (e.g., 10 means scores will be in the range 0-10).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - explanation_required: If true, the LLM should provide a textual explanation along with the score.\n    - evaluation_type: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., 'numeric', 'binary', 'qualitative'). Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores of the following texts: \"The tourists are exploring the historic city center.\", \"The kids are playing soccer in the park.\", \"The new policy aims to improve public transportation and reduce traffic congestion.\", \"The smell of freshly baked cookies wafted through the air.\", \"The researchers are studying the effects of climate change on polar bears.\", \"The city is famous for its art museums and galleries.\" with a batch size of 16 and adding a start token, and then I would like to use the LLM Judge API to evaluate the fluency, coherence, and relevance of the texts: \"The company is investing in sustainable energy sources and reducing its carbon footprint.\", \"The students are working on a project to develop a new sustainable product and improve public transportation.\" with an explanation, a scale max of 10, and a prompt template \"Please assess these texts for fluency, coherence, and relevance in the context of a business sustainability report\", and then use the perplexity API to evaluate the perplexity of the LLM Judge API's outputs.",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\nMetric name: perplexity\n  Description: Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: input text, where each separate text snippet is one list entry.\n    - model_id: model_id (str): model used for calculating Perplexity. NOTE: Perplexity can only be calculated for causal language models, such as gpt2, causal variations of bert, causal versions of t5. (e.g., 'gpt2').\n  Optional parameters:\n    - batch_size: the batch size to run texts through the model.\n    - add_start_token: whether to add the start token to the texts, so the perplexity can include the probability of the first word.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexity scores of the texts: \"Green roofs can help reduce urban heat islands and improve air quality\", \"The city's green infrastructure initiative aims to increase the number of green spaces by 20% in the next 5 years\", \"The innovative startup is developing a smart green roof system that can detect and mitigate the effects of heat islands\" with a batch size of 32 and adding a start token, and then I would like to use the LLM Judge API to evaluate the fluency, coherence, and relevance of the texts: \"The new policy aims to promote sustainable development and reduce carbon emissions in the region while enhancing the quality of life for its citizens\", \"The local community is coming together to promote environmental conservation and reduce waste in the community\", \"The local market offers a unique shopping experience with a focus on handmade crafts and local artwork\", \"The historic neighborhood is a charming area with well-preserved architecture and a rich history\", \"The scenic views from the top of the hill are breathtaking\", \"The local art scene is thriving with numerous galleries and museums\", using a custom prompt template: \"Please evaluate the texts based on their ability to engage the reader and convey the main message effectively\", with an evaluation type of 'numeric' and requiring an explanation.",

BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores for the summaries ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping soundly'] and references ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping soundly'] with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 5 and smoothing enabled, and the ROUGE scores for these summaries and translations with ROUGE's types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] and aggregator disabled, and stemmer applied, and also the BERTScores for these summaries and references with language set to 'en' and inverse document frequency reweighting enabled, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] and references ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the cat is sleeping peacefully'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rouge2'] and aggregator enabled, and stemmer applied, and the BERTScores for these summaries and references with language set to 'en' and inverse document frequency reweighting disabled?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU scores for the generated summaries ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is barking'] and ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'] against the human-written summaries [['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is barking'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping']] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator true, use_stemmer true, and also against the references ['the cat is sleeping the dog is barking the sun is shining', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding'] with BLEU max_order 4, smooth false?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores for the machine translations ['the new policy has been implemented successfully', 'the government is committed to its success and making it work'], human references ['the new policy has been implemented', 'the government is committed to its success'], and model references ['the new policy has been implemented successfully and is working well', 'the government is committed to its success and implementation'] with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 5, smoothing enabled, and the BERTScores for these translations and references with language set to 'en', inverse document frequency reweighting enabled, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the new policy has been well-received by the public', 'the government is committed to implementing the new policy and making adjustments as needed'] and ['the new policy has been widely accepted by the public', 'the government is committed to ensuring its success'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'], aggregator enabled, stemming applied, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the new policy has been a game-changer', 'the government is committed to its success and implementation'] and ['the new policy has been well-received and is expected to have a positive impact', 'the government is committed to making it work'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'], aggregator disabled, no stemming applied.",

Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and METEOR scores for the following summaries and references, with ROUGE's types set to ['rougeLsum'], aggregator enabled, stemmer applied, and METEOR's n-gram order set to 3, given the predictions ['the dog is very happy', 'the cat is sleeping'] and references [['the dog is very happy and playing', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], ['the dog is very happy and playing', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']], and also calculate the BERTScore for these summaries and references with language set to 'en', inverse document frequency reweighting enabled, and smooth BLEU score with maximum n-gram order set to 2?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types as 'rouge1', 'rouge2', and 'rougeL', using the aggregator and with stemming, for the generated summaries: 'The restaurant's unique atmosphere combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a hint of elegance and a touch of modernity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of modernity and a touch of elegance', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The new restaurant offers a unique menu that combines traditional and modern flavors with a dash of creativity and a hint of elegance and a touch of modernity', and also calculate the BLEU scores for the translations: 'The cat is sitting on the mat', 'a quick brown fox', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping on the couch', 'the brown fox is jumping over the dog', 'the dog is running quickly outside'?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nHow does the BLEU score change when the maximum n-gram order is increased from 3 to 6, and smoothing is disabled for the predictions ['the dog is barking loudly', 'the cat is purring softly'] against the references [['the dog is barking very loudly', 'the cat is purring very softly'], ['a fast brown fox is jumping quickly', 'a fast brownish fox is jumping slowly']]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU metrics for the generated summaries ['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is barking'] and ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly'] against the human-written summaries [['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is barking'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly']] and [['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is sleeping'], ['the cat is barking', 'the dog is sleeping']] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator true, use_stemmer true, max_order 4, smooth false, and also against the references ['the cat is barking the dog is sleeping the sun is shining the sky is blue'] with BLEU max_order 4, smooth false, and compare the ROUGE and BLEU results for the first generated summary against the first human-written summary and the first reference, and also compare the ROUGE and BLEU results for the second generated summary against the second human-written summary and the second reference?",

BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU metrics for the generated summaries ['the cat is sleeping peacefully', 'the dog is barking loudly', 'the sun is shining brightly'] and ['the dog is playing energetically', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is hiding behind the clouds'] against the human-written summaries [['the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the dog is barking', 'the sun is shining'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is hiding'], ['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']] and [['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is barking', 'the sun is hiding'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is shining'], ['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']] and [['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is barking', 'the sun is shining'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is hiding'], ['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator true, use_stemmer true, and also against the references ['the cat is barking the dog is sleeping the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding the grass is green the sun is shining the sky is blue'] with BLEU max_order 4, smooth false, and also against the references ['the cat is sleeping the dog is barking the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding the grass is green the sun is shining the sky is blue', 'the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly'] with BLEU max_order 4, smooth false, and compare the ROUGE and BLEU results for the first generated summary against the third human-written summary and the first reference, and also compare the ROUGE and BLEU results for the second generated summary against the second human-written summary and the second reference.",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types as 'rouge1', 'rouge2', and 'rougeL', using the aggregator, and with stemming, for the generated summaries: 'The restaurant's unique atmosphere combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience provides a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of elegance', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance', and also calculate the BLEU scores with max_order as 4 and smooth as true for the summaries: 'The restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The menu blends traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience offers a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance', and also calculate the BERTScores with idf as true for the summaries: 'The restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience provides a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of elegance', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance'.",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with max_order=5 and smooth=true for the predictions ['the cat is very happy, the dog is running quickly', 'the dog is very happy, the cat is running quickly'] and the references [['the cat is purring, the cat is meowing', 'the dog is running fast, the dog is running quickly'], ['the cat is purring, the cat is meowing', 'the dog is running quickly, the dog is wagging its tail']], and the BERTScore with idf=true for the predictions ['the big brown bear is smiling, the big brown bear is happy'] and the references ['the big brown bear is smiling, the big brown bear is happy, the big brown bear is wagging its tail'], and the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) with use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=false, rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'] for the predictions ['a quick brown fox is jumping over the fence, the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly, a quick brown fox is jumping over the fence'] and the references [['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog', 'the cat is purring, the cat is meowing'], ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the fence, the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the quick brown fox is jumping over the fence, the cat is sleeping soundly']].",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU scores for the following predictions: predictions = ['the cat sat on the mat', 'the quick brown fox'], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=True, references = ['the cat sat on the mat the dog', 'the cat is sitting on the mat the dog is very happy'], max_order=4, smooth=False?",
