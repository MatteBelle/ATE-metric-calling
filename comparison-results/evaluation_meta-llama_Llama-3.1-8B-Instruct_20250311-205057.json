The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following summaries and references, with ROUGE's types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeSU4'], aggregator disabled, no stemming applied, and given the predictions ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping'] and references [['the dog is very happy and playing', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], ['the dog is very happy', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']], and also calculate the BLEU score for these summaries and references with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 4, smoothing disabled, and the BERTScore for these summaries and references with language set to 'en', inverse document frequency reweighting disabled?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-2, and BLEU scores with max_order=4 and smooth=true, for these two generated summaries: \"The new product will revolutionize the industry with its innovative features\" and \"The company is making a significant investment in R&D\", with these three reference summaries: \"The new product will revolutionize the industry with its innovative features\", \"The company is investing heavily in research and development\", \"The product will be a major success\"?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat', 'the quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog'] and references ['the cat is very happy and playing the dog is sleeping', 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog quickly'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge2', 'rougeL'] and aggregator disabled, and stemmer applied, and also the BLEU scores for the machine translations ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog quickly', 'the cat is very happy and playing the dog is sleeping soundly'] and human references ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog quickly', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping soundly'] with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 4, smoothing enabled, and the ROUGE scores for these translations and summaries with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'], aggregator enabled, and no stemming applied, and BERTScores for these summaries and references with language set to 'en' and inverse document frequency reweighting enabled?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types as 'rouge1', 'rouge2', and 'rougeL', using the aggregator, and with stemming, for the generated summaries: 'The restaurant's unique atmosphere combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience provides a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of elegance', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance', and also calculate the BLEU scores with max_order as 4 and smooth as true for the summaries: 'The restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The menu blends traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience offers a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of modernity', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance', and also calculate the BERTScores with idf as true for the summaries: 'The restaurant has a unique atmosphere that combines traditional and modern elements with a touch of elegance and a hint of sophistication', 'The menu offers a blend of traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of modernity', 'The dining experience provides a unique combination of traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern elements and a hint of elegance', 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of sophistication', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern cuisine with a dash of creativity and a touch of elegance'.",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU metrics for the generated summaries ['the cat is sleeping peacefully', 'the dog is barking loudly', 'the sun is shining brightly'] and ['the dog is playing energetically', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is hiding behind the clouds'] against the human-written summaries [['the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the dog is barking', 'the sun is shining'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is hiding'], ['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']] and [['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is barking', 'the sun is hiding'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is shining'], ['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']] and [['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is barking', 'the sun is shining'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly', 'the sun is hiding'], ['the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator true, use_stemmer true, and also against the references ['the cat is barking the dog is sleeping the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding the grass is green the sun is shining the sky is blue'] with BLEU max_order 4, smooth false, and also against the references ['the cat is sleeping the dog is barking the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding the grass is green the sun is shining the sky is blue', 'the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly'] with BLEU max_order 4, smooth false, and compare the ROUGE and BLEU results for the first generated summary against the third human-written summary and the first reference, and also compare the ROUGE and BLEU results for the second generated summary against the second human-written summary and the second reference.",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum'].

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) with use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=true, rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rougeL'] for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the dog is running slowly'] and the references [['the dog runs quickly', 'the cat is happy'], ['the dog is running slowly', 'the cat is happy']], and the BLEU scores with max_order=3 and smooth=false for the predictions ['a blue bird is singing a sweet melody', 'the morning sun shines brightly'] and the references [['a blue bird sings a sweet melody', 'the morning sun shines brightly'], ['a blue bird is singing a beautiful song', 'the morning sun is shining in the clear blue sky']], and the BERTScore with idf=true for the predictions ['the cat is purring', 'the dog is barking'] and the references [['the cat purrs', 'the dog barks'], ['the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the dog is barking loudly']], and the ROUGE score rougeL for the predictions ['the cat is very happy, the dog is very happy'] and the references ['the cat is happy, the dog is happy']?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 8 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky']] and the predictions ['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog slowly'] against the references [['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']]?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores for the summaries ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping soundly'] and references ['the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping', 'the dog is very happy and playing the cat is sleeping soundly'] with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 5 and smoothing enabled, and the ROUGE scores for these summaries and translations with ROUGE's types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] and aggregator disabled, and stemmer applied, and also the BERTScores for these summaries and references with language set to 'en' and inverse document frequency reweighting enabled, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the lazy dog', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] and references ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the cat is sleeping peacefully'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rouge2'] and aggregator enabled, and stemmer applied, and the BERTScores for these summaries and references with language set to 'en' and inverse document frequency reweighting disabled?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 7 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] against the references [['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the fox jumps over the lazy dog']] and the predictions ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky with a few white clouds']]?",

BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with max_order=5 and smooth=true for the predictions ['the cat is very happy, the dog is running quickly', 'the dog is very happy, the cat is running quickly'] and the references [['the cat is purring, the cat is meowing', 'the dog is running fast, the dog is running quickly'], ['the cat is purring, the cat is meowing', 'the dog is running quickly, the dog is wagging its tail']], and the BERTScore with idf=true for the predictions ['the big brown bear is smiling, the big brown bear is happy'] and the references ['the big brown bear is smiling, the big brown bear is happy, the big brown bear is wagging its tail'], and the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) with use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=false, rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'] for the predictions ['a quick brown fox is jumping over the fence, the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly, a quick brown fox is jumping over the fence'] and the references [['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog', 'the cat is purring, the cat is meowing'], ['the quick brown fox is jumping over the fence, the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the quick brown fox is jumping over the fence, the cat is sleeping soundly']].",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores for the machine translations ['the beautiful morning', 'the sun is shining brightly'], human references ['the beautiful morning with a cup of coffee', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], and model references ['the morning is beautiful', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky'] with BLEU's maximum n-gram order set to 5, smoothing disabled, and also the BERTScores for these translations and references with language set to 'en', inverse document frequency reweighting disabled, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky with a few fluffy white clouds'], human references ['the morning is beautiful', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], and model references ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], aggregator enabled, and no stemming applied, and the ROUGE scores for the summaries ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining'], human references ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the morning is beautiful'], and model references ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the morning is beautiful and the sun is shining'] with ROUGE's types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'], aggregator enabled, and stemmer applied?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU metrics for the generated summaries ['the cat is sleeping peacefully', 'the dog is barking loudly'] and ['the cat is running quickly', 'the dog is playing energetically'] against the human-written summaries [['the cat is sleeping soundly', 'the dog is barking'], ['the dog is playing outside', 'the cat is running quickly'], ['the dog is sleeping the cat is running the sun is hiding the grass is green the sky is blue'], ['the cat is barking the dog is sleeping the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green']] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator true, use_stemmer true, and also against the references ['the cat is barking the dog is sleeping the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green', 'the dog is sleeping the cat is running slowly the sun is hiding the grass is green the sun is shining the sky is blue'] with BLEU max_order 4, smooth false, and also against the references ['the dog is sleeping the cat is running the sun is hiding the grass is green the sky is blue', 'the cat is barking the dog is sleeping the sun is shining the sky is blue the grass is green'] with BLEU max_order 5, smooth true, and compare the ROUGE and BLEU scores for the first generated summary against the last human-written summary?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types as 'rouge1', 'rouge2', and 'rougeL', using the aggregator, and with stemming, for the generated summaries: 'The new restaurant offers a unique dining experience that combines traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of elegance and a dash of creativity', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of sophistication', 'The new restaurant has a unique menu that combines traditional and modern flavors with a dash of creativity and a hint of elegance', and also calculate the BERTScores with idf as true for the summaries: 'The restaurant offers a unique menu that combines traditional and modern flavors with a hint of sophistication and a touch of elegance', 'The new restaurant has a unique menu that blends traditional and modern flavors with a dash of creativity and a hint of sophistication', 'The new restaurant offers a menu that combines traditional flavors with modern twists and a hint of elegance and a dash of sophistication', and finally, calculate the BLEU scores with max_order as 5 and smooth as true for the translations: 'The new restaurant serves traditional and modern cuisine with a twist', 'The restaurant offers a unique blend of traditional and modern flavors', 'The new restaurant has a unique menu', 'The restaurant serves a mix of traditional and modern dishes', 'The new restaurant offers a menu that combines flavors', 'The restaurant has a menu that blends traditional and modern tastes'.",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following predictions and references, using the default rouge types, aggregator, and stemmer settings, but also computing BERTScore with inverse document frequency reweighting for English language, and comparing the cosine similarity between each generated sentence and its corresponding reference sentence? predictions = ['The dog is very happy', 'The cat sat on the mat', 'The sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky'], references = [['The dog is very happy and the cat is very playful', 'The cat sat on the mat', 'The sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky'], ['The dog is very happy', 'The cat sat on the mat and the dog is very happy', 'The sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky']]",
